# PasswordGenerator
This project required finishing the javascript for a password generator app wherein the user is given a series of choices to create a random password.
These choices include a password length that must be between 8 and 128 characters, as well as what types of characters the password will consist of.
Upon choosing the makeup of their password, the user is delivered a randomly generated and ultra secure password!
